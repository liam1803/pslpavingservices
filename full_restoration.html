                <h1> PSL Paving Restoration Nottingham </h1> 
                <p> Our services provide solutions  for virtually any block paving or tarmacadam restoration problem 
					and in addition to making your refurbished area look good we also extend its life and resistance to 
					damage by weather or normal wear and tear.
 					</p>
				<h2> Block Paving </h2>
                <p> We use a proven process for refurbishing and restoring block paving</p>

  					<p> - The surface is cleaned and prepared using specialist equipment.</p>
 					<p> - Part of the sand is cleared from the joints to remove weed seeds and moss spores. </p>
  					<p> -The joints are re-sanded using sterile kiln-dried sand.</p>
  					<p> -Two coats of specially formulated resin seal is applied, the first coat is rolled by hand so the 
    			     seal can be pressed into each joint for the maximum hardening of the sand joints. The second 
    				 coat is sprayed to give the whole area an even finish thus giving the drive the best protection 
    				 from further weed growth and protecting the sub base from erosion.</p>
               <h2> Tarmacdam </h2>
               <p> Tarmac drives and other areas can be made to look like new and stay looking good by being more 
				   resistant to fading and stains. We have specialist tools and equipment to facilitate restoration and
				   repair in one process.  </p>
               <p> - The surface is thoroughly cleaned. 
 				  <p> - Damaged areas are cut and replaced with new big tarmac.
                   <p> - Surface Stains are treated and weeds removed. 
                  <p> - A specially formulated Bitumenous Seal is applied by a pressurised spray or roller to give uniform
                     coating.     
               <h2> Imprinted Concrete </h2> 
               <p> As with all of our processes we have a specialist solution to the problems 
				   associated with imprinted concrete to enable us to refurbish your drive and 
				   protect it for the future. </p>
               <p>   - The surface is thoroughly prepared using specialist cleaning and 
    				   degreasing equipment. 
  				     <p> - Tyre Marks, oil and grease stains removed.  
                    <p> - Debris is Removed. 
                    <p> - Damaged areas can often be repaired using state of the art repair resins. 
                    <p> - Surfaces can be tinted to meet your requirements. 
                    <p> - Badly degraded areas are treated with heavy application of High Solids 
                       Resin. 
                    <p> - A coat of a specially developed maintenance mix are applied. 
                     <p>- The surface is then finished with a Matt or Gloss finish and a low slip 
                     finish where required. </p>
